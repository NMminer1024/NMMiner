# NMMiner - New ESP32 Solo Miner

- Deeply optimazion for ESP32-S3: Achieves high performance of 120kH/s with a single chip in solo miner mode, while maintaining low power consumption.

## Requirements
- ESP32s3 boards from [heltec](https://heltec.org/project/vision-master-t190/) as so far.
- [Putty](https://www.putty.org/) (optional, web monitor instead since [v0.2.11](#20240827---v0211))
- 3D BOX (in progress, coming soon)

## Features
- SHA256d deeply optimazation for ESP32-S3, max hashrate: 119 KH/s
- NMController_client, [source code](https://github.com/NMminer1024/NMController_client), we put the *_x64.msi and *_x86.msi in tool folder already, just install, only for Windows
- NMController_web, [source code](https://github.com/NMminer1024/NMController_web), it's a Python implement, for Windows and Mac.

### NMMiner Configuration
***
#### Normal configuration

1. Press and hold the **User** button, then click the **Reset** button, wait until the QR code appears, then release the **User** button.

<div align="center">
  <img src="fig/nmap.png" alt="AP Config">
</div>

2. Search for AP named: nmap-2.4g, enter password: 12345678

3.  If connect to AP via mobile phone and everything goes well, you will be redirected to the configuration page; if connect to AP via PC, just log in: 192.168.4.1.

<div align="center">
  <img src="fig/config-1.png" alt="config-1">
</div>

4. You will see the following page. Follow the steps to configure your mining machine. The larger the UI refresh value, the higher the hash rate, and the hash rate will also increase when the screen is turned off.

</div>

5. You can return to the configuration page at any time and refer to the [button](#buttons) operations.

6. In some areas, the pool is blocked by the local firewall. If you have an SSL encrypted channel, you can enable this option.

7. When you click **Save** it will take a while (10-15 seconds), do not reset the miner manually, just let it restart automatically.
***
#### firmware update
- Please confirm that the firmware folder contains support for the ESP32 board you have.
- Here, we use the T190 hardware as an example, Open the folder **'firmware/heltec-vision-master-t190'**, connect your Miner to your computer, then try to click **fw_update.exe**.

<div align="center">
  <img src="fig/fw.png" alt="fw">
</div>

- It would be better that there is only one COM port on your computer, **fw_update.exe** search the COM list on your computer and select the largest COM port index as the target port. So if there are more than one COMx, make sure the T190 COM port index is the largest one on your computer, just as belowï¼š

<div align="center">
  <img src="fig/comx.jpg" alt="comx">
</div>

- If some error occur when you update the firmware as below, one of the solutions as follow: 

##### Error:
<div align="center">
  <img src="fig/fwup-failed.png" alt="fw failed">
</div>

##### solutions:

  a). Hold **boot** button;

  b). Wait 1s;

  c). Then click **reset** button;

  d). Wait 1s;

  e). Release **boot** button;

  f). Click **fw_update.exe**.

## Pool
- Due to the very limited on-chip resources of the ESP32, some high-difficulty mining pools currently reject our connections. [public-pool.io](https://web.public-pool.io/) is a mining pool that accepts low-difficulty miners. We appreciate their efforts.

## How to monitor

- We make an example by NMController_client

- ***NMController***, scan the machine in your LAN, just as below.

- Redirect to the web monitor for more details.
